# **Hey, I'm data-sandbox!**
<br>
Welcome to my digital sandbox. ⛱

I'm a data scientist who worked as a mechanical engineer, consultant, and researcher in the past.

I make [open-source projects](https://data-sandbox.github.io/projects/) and [write](https://data-sandbox.github.io/blog/) about data for fun. I like trails, bikes, brews, and sourdough. 🏔🚲🍻🥖
