NYC's Citibike bikeshare program is a commonly used dataset for data science projects. But Boston has its own bikeshare program, [Bluebikes](https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data), which also publishes trip history data every quarter. As a former Boston resident and bike commuter, I wanted to make sure Boston's bikeshare program got the same level of attention.

In this project, I used machine learning (ML) to create a ridership time series forecasting model. This time series model was generated by modeling signal drift, seasonality, and residual noise.

 I also developed an online learning model that is able to analyze incoming data in real time and learn from this future data, enabling continuous maintenance of the model. This is needed in production so that the model can continue to provide accurate insights to the business.

 Lastly, I used the model to perform anomaly detection in order to identify outlier days in ridership demand. I also attempted to use my domain knowledge to explore possible explanations for the outliers. Spoiler alert: the MBTA Orange Line shutdown and resulting Bluebikes free pass program unsurprisingly appears to have caused a spike in ridership!

All code for this can be found on [github](https://github.com/data-sandbox/ml-bluebikes-forecasting).
