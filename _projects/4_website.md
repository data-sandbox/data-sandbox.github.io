Before building this website, I had little knowledge of HTML or CSS. And thanks to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that's fortunately still the case!

Jekyll makes it easy to generate a simple, static website that looks professional. But the real power comes from Jekyll's use of markdown, which greatly simplifies and streamlines the process of adding or maintaining content. And thanks to the extensive list of community-maintained themes, finding a style that suits you is easy!

All code for this can be found on [github](https://github.com/data-sandbox/data-sandbox.github.io).
